## My Setups

So as a first post to my blog, I'm sharing my configuration.\
This post is going to be updated regularly. Probably..

## Hyprland

So this is my hyprland setup.\
The distro I'm using is archlinux.\
My Setup contains 2 default wallpapers, just press `SUPER+W` to change between them.\
My wallpaper keybinding both changes `hyprpaper` and `hyprlock` wallpapers.\
To add more wallpapers just add wallpapers to `~/.config/hypr/wallpapers/` directory, after running `setup.sh`.\
